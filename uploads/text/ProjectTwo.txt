I designed the Swallow Crest Farm website with a strong focus on community engagement and storytelling. A key feature is the blog section, where visitors can explore insightful articles, updates, and behind-the-scenes stories about the farm. I structured it to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, ensuring that readers can quickly find content that resonates with them. Whether it's seasonal farming tips, personal reflections, or news about farm events, the blog serves as a dynamic space for sharing knowledge and fostering connections.
To enhance interaction, I built a share section that allows users to easily spread content across social platforms. This feature encourages engagement, helping the farm build a network of supporters who can connect over shared interests. By integrating seamless sharing options, I’ve made it simple for visitors to amplify their favorite posts and bring more people into the farm’s community. My goal was to create an inviting digital space that not only informs but also encourages meaningful dialogue and participation.
