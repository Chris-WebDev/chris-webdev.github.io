I designed the Forever Friends Humane Society website with a clean and structured layout, ensuring that visitors can easily access essential information. One of the standout features is the data carousel, which provides an intuitive way to display key details such as adoptable animals, success stories, and upcoming events. By implementing a visually appealing and interactive carousel, I made it simple for users to browse through content without feeling overwhelmed. The smooth transitions and well-organized sections help highlight the most important updates while maintaining a seamless user experience.
Beyond aesthetics, the carousel serves a functional role in organizing data efficiently. Each slide is carefully curated to prioritize engagement, using clear visuals and concise descriptions to draw attention to available pets and important news. This approach not only enhances accessibility but also encourages interaction, making it easy for visitors to connect with the organization’s mission. My goal was to create a digital space that effectively showcases Forever Friends Humane Society’s impact while making it effortless for users to explore and take action
